 <p>In this study, you will be required to learn the provided material and complete a short test related to the concept. Prior to taking each test, you will read the related study material once and simultaneously take notes on it e.g. read passage on limit rules and take notes on the material on a sheet of paper. After you have completed this step, you can take the related test immediately. Feel free to take your time when reading the passages and make sure to have a pencil and paper on hand when taking the tests. You are not permitted to refer back to the study material while taking the test. If you are unable to answer a question, try to make your best guess. Repeat this process for all three passages.</p>
